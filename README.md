# Smash.gg Bracket TV Tools and Toolkit

*Not for use on small 15 inch CRTs.*

This is a script and/or toolkit to temporaily reformat the [smash.gg][smashgg]
bracket page (Example: https://smash.gg/tournament/frank-and-son-tournament-5/events/smash-ultimate-singles/brackets/591451/984236)
for big screen "Jumbotron" purposes.

To accomplish this, the brackets page is loaded, and then the Chrome Developer
Tools are popped out. The brackets page is full-sized to the Jumbotron and the
Developer Tools is left on the operator's display. The operator can smoothly
animate the scoreboard and focus on interesting portions of the bracket.

Additionally, branding can be installed behind or in front of the bracket. For
example, logo backgrounds may be inserted. These can be step and repeat patterns
or even animations. Further customization may be possible by overlaying CSS.
